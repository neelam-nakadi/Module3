# Module 3 HTML documents

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Plot of the car dataset

``` r
plot(cars)
```

![](html_document_files/figure-html/cars-1.png)<!-- -->

## Including Plots

### plot of pressure dataset

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](html_document_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
